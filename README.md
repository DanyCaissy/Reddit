A collection of my Reddit bots. Feel free to use, modify and share them. Please star this if you've found anything helpful.

Most of them will include a "credentials" module, it won't be included in each bot's folder, but you can add it yourself by copying [this sample file](https://github.com/DanyCaissy/Reddit/blob/master/sample_credentials.py) in the folder yourself renaming it to "credentials.py" and modifying the variables to your own information.
